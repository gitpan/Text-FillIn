 $template->path('.', '/etc/template_dir');  # Where to find templates
 $template->get_file('my_template'); # Gets ./my_template or /etc/template_dir/my_template

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a class for doing fill-in templates.  These templates may be used
as web pages with dynamic content, e-mail messages with fill-in fields, or whatever other
uses you might think of.  B<Text::FillIn> provides handy methods for fetching files
from the disk, printing a template while interpreting it (also called streaming),
and nested fill-in sections (i.e. expressions like [[ $th[[$thing2]]ing1 ]] are legal).

Note that the version number here is 0.03 - that means that the interface may change
a bit.  In fact, it's already changed some with respect to 0.02 (see the CHANGES file).
In particular, the $LEFT_DELIM, $RIGHT_DELIM, %HOOK, and @TEMPLATE_PATH variables are 
gone, replaced by a default/instance variable system.

I might also change the default hooks or something.  Please read the CHANGES file before upgrading
to find out whether I've changed anything you use.

In this documentation, I generally use "template" to mean "an object of class Text::FillIn".

=head2 Defining the structure of templates

=over 4

=item * delimiters

B<Text::FillIn> has some special variables that it uses to do its work.  You can set
those variables and customize the way templates get filled in.

The delimiters that set fill-in sections of your form apart from the rest of the
form are generally B<[[> and B<]]>, but they don't have to be, you can set 
them to whatever you want.  So you could do this:

 Text::FillIn->Ldelim = '{';
 Text::FillIn->Rdelim = '}';
 $template->set_text('this is a {$variable} and this is a {&function}.');

Whatever you set the delimiter to, you can put backslashes before them in your
templates, to force them not to be interpreted:

 $template->set_text('some [[$[[$var2]][[$var]]]] and some \[[ text \]]');
 $template->interpret_and_print();
 # Prints "some stuff and some [[ text ]]"

You cannot currently have several different kinds of delimiters in a single template.

=item * interpretation hooks

In order to interpret templates, C<Text::FillIn> needs to know how to treat
different kinds of [[tags]] it finds.  The way it accomplishes this is through
"hook functions."  These are various functions that C<Text::FillIn> will run
when confronted with various kinds of fill-in fields.  There are two 
hooks provided by default:

 Text::FillIn->hook('$') is \&find_value,
 Text::FillIn->hook('&') is \&run_function.

So if you leave these hooks the way they are, when B<Text::FillIn> sees
some text like "some [[$vars]] and some [[&funk]]", it will run
C<&Text::FillIn::find_value> to find the value of [[$vars]], and it will
run C<&Text::FillIn::run_function> to find the value of [[&funk]].  This
is based on the first non-whitespace character after the delimiter,
which is required to be a non-word character (no letters, numbers, or
underscores).  You can define hooks for any non-word character you want:

 $template = new Text::FillIn("some [[!mushrooms]] were in my shoes!");
 $template->hook('!', "main::scream_it");  # or \&scream_it
 sub scream_it {
    my $text = shift;
    return uc($text); # Uppercase-it
 }
 $new_text = $template->interpret();
 # Returns "some MUSHROOMS were in my shoes!"

Every hook function will be passed all the text between the delimiters, without
any surrounding whitespace or the leading identifier (the & or $, or whatever).
Hooks can be given as either hard references or symbolic references,
but if they are symbolic, they need to use the complete package name and everything.

=item * the default hook functions

The hook functions installed with the shipping version of this module are
C<&Text::FillIn::find_value> and C<&Text::FillIn::run_function>.  They are 
extremely simple.  I suggest you take a look at them to see how they work.
What follows here is a description of how these functions will fill in your
templates.

The C<&find_value> function looks for an entry in a hash called %main::TVars.
So put an entry in this hash if you want it to be available to templates:

 my $template = new Text::FillIn( 'hey, [[$you]]!' );
 $::TVars{'you'} = 'Sam';
 $template->interpret_and_print();  # Prints "hey, Sam!"

The C<&run_function> function looks for a function in the C<TExport> package and
runs it.  The reason it doesn't look in the main package is that you probably
don't want to make all the functions in your program available to the templates
(not that putting all your program's functions in the main package is always
the greatest programming style).  Here are a couple of ways to make functions
available:

 sub TExport::add_numbers {
    my $result;
    foreach (@_) {
       $result += $_;
    }
    return $result;
 }

 #  or, if you like:
 
 package TExport;
 sub add_numbers {
    my $result;
    foreach (@_) {
       $result += $_;
    }
    return $result;
 }

The C<&run_function> function will split the argument string at commas, and pass
the resultant list to your function:

 my $template = new Text::FillIn(
    'Pi is about [[&add_numbers(3,.1,.04,.001,.0006)]]'
 );
 $template->interpret_and_print;


In the original version of C<Text::FillIn>, I didn't provide any hook functions.
I expected people to write their own, partly because I didn't want to stifle
creativity or anything.  I now include hook functions because the ones I give
will probably work okay for most people, and providing them means it's easier
to use the module right out of "the box."  But I hope you won't be afraid to write
your own hooks - if mine don't work well for you, by all means go ahead and
replace them with your own.  If you think you've written some really killer hooks,
let me know.  I may include cool ones with future distributions.


=item * template directories

You can tell C<Text::FillIn> where to look for templates:

 Text::FillIn->path('.', '/etc/template_dir');
 $template->get_file('my_template'); # Gets ./my_template or /etc/template_dir/my_template

=back



=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * new Text::FillIn($text)

This is the constructor, which means it returns a new object of type B<Text::FillIn>.
If you feed it some text, it will set the template's text to be what you give it:

 $template = new Text::FillIn("some [[$vars]] and some [[&funk]]");

=item * $template->get_file( $filename );

This will look for a template called $filename (in the directories given in 
B<$template-E<gt>path()>) and slurp it in.  If $filename starts with / , 
then B<Text::FillIn> will treat $filename as an absolute path, and not search 
through the directories for it:

 $template->get_file( "my_template" );
 $template->get_file( "/weird/place/with/template" );

The default path is ('.').

=item * $template->interpret()

Returns the interpreted contents of the template:

 $interpreted_text = $template->interpret();

This, along with interpret_and_print, are the main point of this whole module.

=item * $template->interpret_and_print()

Interprets the [[ fill-in parts ]]  of a template and prints the template,
streaming its output as much as possible.  This means that if it encounters
an expression like "[[ stuff [[ more stuff]] ]]", it will fill in [[ more stuff ]],
then use the filled-in value to resolve the value of [[ stuff something ]],
and then print it out.

If it encounters an expression like "stuff1 [[thing1]] stuff2 [[thing2]]",
it will print stuff1, then the value of [[thing1]], then stuff2, then the
value of [[thing2]].  This is as streamed as possible if you want nested
brackets to resolve correctly.

=back

The following methods all get and/or set certain attributes of the template.  They can
all be called as instance methods, a la C<$template-E<gt>Ldelim()>, or as static methods,
a la C<Text::FillIn-E<gt>Ldelim()>.  Using an instance method only changes the given
template, it does not affect the properties of any other template.  Using a static method
will change the default behavior of all templates created in the future.

=over 4

=item * $template->Ldelim($new_delimiter)

=item * $template->Rdelim($new_delimiter)

Get or set the left or right delimiter.  When called with no arguments, simply returns the
delimiter.  When called with an argument, sets the delimiter.

=item * $template->text($new_text)

Get or set the contents of the template.

=item * $template->path($dir1, $dir2, ...)

Get or set the list of directories to search for templates in.  The path is used
in the get_file() method.

=item * $template->hook($character, $hook_function)

Set the functions for filling in the sections of the template between delimiters.  See 
the subsection on interpretation hooks in the DESCRIPTION section.

=item * $template->property( $name, $value );

This method lets you get and set arbitrary properties of the template, like
this:

 $template->property('color', 'blue');  # Set the color
 # ... some code...
 $color = $template->property('color'); # Get the color

The B<Text::FillIn> class doesn't actually pay any attention whatsoever to
the properties - it's purely for your own convenience, so that small changes
in functionality can be achieved without having to subclass B<Text::FillIn>.

=back

=head1 COMMON MISTAKES

If you want to use nested fill-ins on your template, make sure things get 
printed in the order you think they'll be printed.  If you have something like this:
C<[[$var_number_[[&get_number]]]]>, and your &get_number I<prints> a number,
you won't get the results you probably want.  B<Text::FillIn> will print your number,
then try to interpret C<[[$var_number_]]>, which probably won't work.  

The solution is to make &get_number I<return> its number rather than I<print> it.  
Then B<Text::FillIn> will turn C<[[$var_number_[[&get_number]]]]> into 
C<[[$var_number_5]]>, and then print the value of $var_number_5.  That's 
probably what you wanted.

=head1 TO DO

The deprecated methods get_text(), set_text(), get_property(), and set_property()
will be removed in version 0.05 and greater.  Use text() and property() instead.

At the suggestion of Jesse Chisolm, I plan on making it possible to specify a class
object that has the hook functions as methods.  I'm still thinking about how the 
interface will work.

 Idea for the above:
 $template->class($class);  # Can be object, or class name
 $template->hook('$', 'method_in_class');

=head1 BUGS

The interpreting engine can be fooled by certain backslashing sequences like C<\\[[$var]]>,
which looks to it like the C<[[> is backslashed.  I think I know how to fix this, but I need 
to think about it a little.
