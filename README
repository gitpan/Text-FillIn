Hi,

This is the Text::FillIn.pm module.  It is a class for implementing fill-in
text templates.  It is designed to be flexible and sub-classible.

You can specify the delimiters that mark sections of text to be filled in
(for example [[ and ]], or <!-- and -->, or { and } ... you get the picture),
and you can specify the actions to take when filling in those sections.

For more specific information, please see the documentation inside
FillIn.pm, by doing "pod2text FillIn.pm", or "perldoc Text::FillIn" once
you've installed the module.

To install the module, do the usual:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
