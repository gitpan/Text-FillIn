Hi,

This is the Text::FillIn.pm module, version 0.01 (but check $VERSION in
FillIn.pm just to make sure).  It is a class for implementing fill-in text
templates.  It is designed to be flexible and sub-classible.

It also may change significantly - this is only version 0.01, after all =).

For more specific information, please see the documentation inside
FillIn.pm, by doing "pod2txt FillIn.pm", or "perldoc Text::FillIn" once
you've installed the module.

To install the module, do the usual:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Then you can delete the source directory tree since it's no longer needed.
